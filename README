-- P4A - PHP For Applications. --
---------------------------------

------------------
-- Installation --
------------------

Just extract the archive under your web server
DOCUMENT_ROOT (es:/home/httpd/htdocs).

You should rename the directory
"p4a-version" to "p4a".

Open your web browser and go to:

	http://localhost/p4a/

you will now see the list of sample applications
distribuited with p4a.

There are four samples included:
	- sample_en
	- sample_it
	- sample_i18n
	- products_catalogue

sample_en and sample_it are the same application in english
and italian, these applications are very simple and do not
make use of databases.

sample_i18n was created to make users understand P4A i18n
subsystem and how to create multilanguage applications.

products_catalogue is a very simple example of virtual catalogue
for shops. To have this application runnning take a look at
applications/products_catalogue/README

We've also included a schema model image (db_schema.png) and the
DBDesigner source for that (db_schema.xml), so you can better
understand what that db does.

--------------------------
- ADVANCED INSTALLATION --
--------------------------

If you want to have p4a installed out of your document root, this will help
you. We use the debian standard way, extract the framework and put it in

/usr/share/p4a

edit your Apache's httpd.conf and add this lines:

Alias /p4a /usr/share/p4a
<Directory /usr/share/p4a>
 Order allow,deny
 Allow from all
</Directory>
