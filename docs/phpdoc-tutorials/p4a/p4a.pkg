	<para>
		P4A is a fully OO PHP framework for easy building of stateful web applications.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		P4A - PHP For Applications is a
		framework for building web based applications turning
		your internet browser in a smart application container.
	</para>
	<para>
		P4A's architecture lets you build simple ad extremely complex applications keeping
		the code so clean that you would never expect.
	</para>
	<para>
		P4A concept is based upon the want to have a framework for building of
		<em>STATEFUL</em> applications without having to take care about
		state maintenance.
	</para>
	<para>
		Next to this we want a simple but powerful programming interface so P4A
		is totally <em>EVENT</em> driven. Every P4A object can trigger
		actions on specified event, so you can build a web application in the same way
		you would have built it in traditional (client) way, and, above all, you will have
		the same resulting effect.
	</para>
	<para>
		P4A has a powerful, modular and totally expandible set of widget for
		content management applications building. Examples are input fields, simple
		text boxes, text areas with rich editing features, combo box, table widgets
		and so on.
